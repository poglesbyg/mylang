======

following McCarthy's 1960 essay on implementing lisp as well as some of Graham's essay on the "Roots of Lisp"

TODO:
- implement atom 
- implement eq (done)
- implement lambda
- implement cond: checks the car of the first argument returns TRUE then evaluate the next one otherwise go down to the next conditional

THEN:
- use mylang to implement the rest of lisp
